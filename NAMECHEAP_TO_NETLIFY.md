## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Domain is already registered with Netlify"
**Cause:** Someone else already added this domain to their Netlify site.

**Solution:**
- Make sure you own aigrocerylists.com in Namecheap
- Contact Netlify support to claim it
- Or use a different domain

### Problem: DNS not working after 24 hours
**Cause:** DNS records might be incorrect.

**Solution:**
1. Go back to Namecheap → Advanced DNS
2. Double-check the records:
   - A record: Host = `@`, Value = `75.2.60.5`
   - CNAME record: Host = `www`, Value = `cool-flan-309abf.netlify.app`
3. Make sure there are NO other A or CNAME records
4. Try flushing your DNS cache:
   ```bash
   sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
   ```

### Problem: "ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS"
**Cause:** Redirect loop between HTTP and HTTPS.

**Solution:**
1. In Netlify → Domain settings
2. Make sure "Force HTTPS" is enabled
3. Clear your browser cache and try again

### Problem: SSL certificate won't provision
**Cause:** DNS isn't fully propagated yet.

**Solution:**
1. Wait longer (up to 24 hours)
2. Make sure BOTH A and CNAME records are set correctly
3. Try clicking "Provision certificate" again after waiting

### Problem: Site works at cool-flan-309abf.netlify.app but not aigrocerylists.com
**Cause:** DNS hasn't propagated to your location yet.

**Solution:**
1. Check whatsmydns.net to see global propagation
2. Try accessing from mobile data (different network)
3. Clear browser cache and try incognito mode
4. Wait a bit longer

# üîí Fix SSL Certificate Error for aigrocerylists.com

## The Problem
You're seeing: **"Your connection is not private"** with error `ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`

This is normal when you first connect a custom domain. Your DNS is working correctly, but Netlify hasn't issued the SSL certificate yet.

## ‚úÖ The Solution (5 minutes)

### Method 1: Netlify Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to**: https://app.netlify.com/sites/cool-flan-309abf/settings/domain

2. **Scroll down** to the "HTTPS" section

3. You should see one of these options:
   - **"Verify DNS configuration"** - Click this first
   - **"Provision certificate"** - Click this to request SSL
   - **"Renew certificate"** - Click if it shows this

4. **Wait 1-2 minutes** - Netlify will:
   - ‚úÖ Verify your DNS
   - ‚úÖ Request SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
   - ‚úÖ Install it automatically

5. **Refresh your browser** and try https://aigrocerylists.com again

### Method 2: If you see "Waiting for DNS propagation"

Sometimes Netlify needs time to detect your DNS changes:

1. **Wait 10-30 minutes** for DNS to fully propagate
2. Go back to the HTTPS section
3. Click **"Verify DNS configuration"** again
4. Then click **"Provision certificate"**

### Method 3: Use HTTP temporarily

While waiting for SSL, you can access your site using:
- **http://aigrocerylists.com** (without the 's')
- **https://cool-flan-309abf.netlify.app** (your Netlify URL always has SSL)

## üîç Check SSL Status

Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/cool-flan-309abf/settings/domain

Look for:
- ‚úÖ **"HTTPS enabled"** = Working!
- ‚è≥ **"Waiting for certificate"** = Be patient, check back in 5-10 minutes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **"DNS not configured"** = DNS records need adjustment

## ‚è±Ô∏è How Long?

- **Usually**: 1-5 minutes
- **Sometimes**: 30 minutes to 1 hour
- **Maximum**: 24 hours (if DNS is slow to propagate)

## üÜò Still Not Working After 1 Hour?

Contact Netlify Support:
1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/support
2. Say: "My custom domain aigrocerylists.com needs SSL certificate provisioning"
3. They'll help you immediately!

## üìù Current Status

- ‚úÖ DNS is configured correctly
- ‚úÖ Domain points to Netlify
- ‚úÖ aigrocerylists.com resolves properly
- ‚è≥ SSL certificate needs to be provisioned

**Next step**: Go to the Netlify dashboard and provision the certificate!
